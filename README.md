# Not Urgent but Important App

## Why

When was it last time you called your grandma? When did you take 5minutes to meditate in the middle of the day? Did you already cleaned your desk?

These are tasks we know are beneficial and we know they would not take too much time. But somehow they never climb up our priority list.

This app aims to change it.

## Why II

I also need to practice my React Skillz on something at least barely useful ;-)

## How

This app allows you to define list of tasks and then lets you randomly display it to you.

So instead of logging into Twitter when you have that spare 5minutes, you can get reminded of the important stuff

## Definition of done

- Mobile only
- navbar
- react router switch
- Main Page: display randomly selected tasks
  - Tasks displayed as boxes that fill entire width
- Setup Page: input the long list of tasks
  - You can insert, edit or delete task
  - reorder ???
- ServerLess functions
  - Load tasks for specific user
  - Update existing task
  - Delete Task
  - Create new task
- Only signed in users allowed (obv), they see only their own content
- use 2 color palettes
- use context somehow...
